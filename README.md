# habit-list
it have one add button from which we can add the habits along with their title and description.
once the habit is being added we can view it in two ways :- 
1. List view :- in which status can be changed for today. 
2. calendar view :- here we can change the status for today as well as previous 6 days.

there are mainly 3 status :
1. done
2. none
3. todo

To store the state we have used to react-redux and to move from list view to calender view we have used the react router.
